For my final project, I would like to look into rendering realistic hair/fur. I would like to look into setting up a shader that can utilize spline rendering techniques to mimic hair textures. I would like to add various fields that can be adjusted either via hard values or texture look ups to give it more varied looks. If possible as a stretch goal I would like to add in effects that help simulate physics.

Week 1: Setup the spline rendering pipeline

Week 2: Implement texture look ups for control over various aspects of the hair such as stiffness and clumping

Week 3: Add Lighting Via the Kajiya-Kay reflection model

Week 4: Add in verlet integration and simplified physics

Week 5: (Stretch goal) Add in simple physics collisions and various other polish 

I would like to try using THREE.js to impliment this, however depending on it's limitations I may inside try to do everything from scratch using the normal js libraries.
